            <div class="question">What is Publica?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Publica is a new global distribution channel for books of all kinds. All languages, all countries. We don’t need you to sign over your rights, you don’t need to fit our business model because we will program yours into the system called blockchain. "If an author can say it, we can program it," according to COO Antons Sapriko.</p>
                <p>Buyers’ money straight from their wallets to sellers’ wallets. It’s as simple as that. Publica takes no exclusive rights from an author because the transactions are locked in a smart contract on the blockchain. The business model and the revenue belong directly to the author.</p>

            <div class="question">I'm an author. Where can I upload my book/start my Book ICO?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The Publica platform is still in development so uploading and publishing a book to the Publica platform is not available to the public at the moment.</p>
                <p>If you are an author that wants to publish his book on Publica you can fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdB6C8UHroJZPFmhUP6UmFWhKZAEhoZ0e-lDGynY86JujlcBQ/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a> and it will add your book to a list of pending authors and we will CONTACT YOU if we decide to publish your book before Publica is openly available to authors.</p>
                <p>Similarly if you want to run a BOOK ICO before the platform is fully launched, please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXtxTDd5ryHVm50fJzTJsTAh-gwfakIpXWjp2QqIAgX8ZtGQ/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a>!</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How much does it cost to publish my book on Publica?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Nothing! It is absolutely FREE to publish your book on Publica. Publica makes its money by taking a 10% fee from every book purchased. </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Can I purchase books on Publica with X traditional currency?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Currently Publica only supports PBL Tokens as the currency to purchase books on the Publica platform. We do plan to implement an option to buy books with other currencies, including fiat money (USD, EUR, etc.). </p>

        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Would it be an issue that I'm already selling on X platform/ X Publisher?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Not from Publica's side. Publica doesn't demand any exclusivity from the author, you keep full-control of where and when to publish as far as Publica is concerned. You must however refer to your terms with your current publisher. </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Are you able to continue selling your book on Publica after you finish the BOOK ICO?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes, of course, you continue to sell the book after the ICO ends, just with a post-ICO price. The general practice for ICOs is that you sell the tokens for a lower price during the ICO and after it ends they go to the regular/higher price so to provide incentive for people to invest early. </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How is my work protected from piracy?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>How the Blockchain is protecting your book:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The user can only access the book file using Publica reader app.</li>
                    <li>It is required to have a BOOK token to access the book.</li>
                    <li>It is impossible to copy or fake BOOK tokens.</li>
                    <li>Books are cryptographically protected and it is not possible to download a book from the app.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Does Publica protect my books copyrights?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>From a legal perspective the copyrights of an author's book are his/her responsibility, Publica ensures that the registered author is who he/she says he/she is and has the right to sell the existing book. The blockchain upon which Publica is built only allows access to the book to those who have purchased an access key.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">When will Publica be available in other languages?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>We are planning to do more languages in the future, but currently the Publica platform is only available in english. However, you will still be able to publish books in any language, regardless what the language of the platform is.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">What are PBL and BOOK tokens?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>We found a smart way to use an ERC20 token in publishing.</p>
                <p>Instead of selling ebooks, authors are selling BOOK tokens. Tokens are working as an access key to the contents of the book. Smart contracts will work as a decentralized eCommerce store, where authors will sell BOOK tokens and readers will be granted access to their book via Publica's e-reader app-wallet.</p>
                <p>Naturally, we want this eCommerce protocol to run on Publica currency, PBL. PBL is a platform currency, everything happening on the platform should be denominated in PBL and paid in PBL.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Why do they call Publica - Ethereum for Ebooks?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Ethereum is known for a booming multi-billion ICO market. Publica is a small Ethereum tailored for publishing.</p>
                <p>We help to run ICOs to crowdfund creation of new books. Authors will build communities of fans, do marketing, come up with an exciting pricing and will use funds to create high-quality titles while keeping their creative freedom and IP rights. No need to sign thick contracts with large publishers that take away their freedom and leave mere 10% of the earnings!</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Why does Publica need a blockchain?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The publishing ecosystem needs a radical expansion of the popular phrase “trust, but verify.” Blockchain provides transparency.</p>
                <p>So, Publica has to put trust and verification on the blockchain by automating the ecommerce, engaging the blockchain that holds the ebook and derivative rights public keys, and their smart contracts, and the app/wallets involved in the ecommerce.</p>
                <p>Blockchain, smart-contracts and tokens sounds complicated..</p>
                <p>As an author or reader your don't need to think about the blockchain, smart-contracts or other technical details. It all will work under-the-hood in the Publica platform.</p>
