            <div class="question">What is Publica?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Publica is a new global distribution channel for books of all kinds. All languages, all countries. We don’t need you to sign over your rights, you don’t need to fit our business model because we will program yours into the system called blockchain. "If an author can say it, we can program it," according to COO Antons Sapriko.</p>
                <p>Buyers’ money straight from their wallets to sellers’ wallets. It’s as simple as that. Publica takes no exclusive rights from an author because the transactions are locked in a smart contract on the blockchain. The business model and the revenue belong directly to the author.</p>

            <div class="question">I'm an author. Where can I upload my book/start my Book ICO?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The Publica platform is still in development so uploading and publishing a book to the Publica platform is not available to the public at the moment.</p>
                <p>If you are an author that wants to publish his book on Publica you can fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdB6C8UHroJZPFmhUP6UmFWhKZAEhoZ0e-lDGynY86JujlcBQ/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a> and it will add your book to a list of pending authors and we will CONTACT YOU if we decide to publish your book before Publica is openly available to authors.</p>
                <p>Similarly if you want to run a BOOK ICO before the platform is fully launched, please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXtxTDd5ryHVm50fJzTJsTAh-gwfakIpXWjp2QqIAgX8ZtGQ/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a>!</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How much does it cost to publish my book on Publica?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Nothing! It is absolutely FREE to publish your book on Publica. Publica makes its money by taking a 10% fee from every book purchased. </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Can I purchase books on Publica with X traditional currency?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Currently Publica only supports PBL Tokens as the currency to purchase books on the Publica platform. We do plan to implement an option to buy books with other currencies, including fiat money (USD, EUR, etc.). </p>

        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Would it be an issue that I'm already selling on X platform/ X Publisher?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Not from Publica's side. Publica doesn't demand any exclusivity from the author, you keep full-control of where and when to publish as far as Publica is concerned. You must however refer to your terms with your current publisher. </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Are you able to continue selling your book on Publica after you finish the BOOK ICO?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes, of course, you continue to sell the book after the ICO ends, just with a post-ICO price. The general practice for ICOs is that you sell the tokens for a lower price during the ICO and after it ends they go to the regular/higher price so to provide incentive for people to invest early. </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How is my work protected from piracy?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>How the Blockchain is protecting your book:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The user can only access the book file using Publica reader app.</li>
                    <li>It is required to have a BOOK token to access the book.</li>
                    <li>It is impossible to copy or fake BOOK tokens.</li>
                    <li>Books are cryptographically protected and it is not possible to download a book from the app.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Does Publica protect my books copyrights?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>From a legal perspective the copyrights of an author's book are his/her responsibility, Publica ensures that the registered author is who he/she says he/she is and has the right to sell the existing book. The blockchain upon which Publica is built only allows access to the book to those who have purchased an access key.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">When will Publica be available in other languages?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>We are planning to do more languages in the future, but currently the Publica platform is only available in english. However, you will still be able to publish books in any language, regardless what the language of the platform is.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">What are PBL and BOOK tokens?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>We found a smart way to use an ERC20 token in publishing.</p>
                <p>Instead of selling ebooks, authors are selling BOOK tokens. Tokens are working as an access key to the contents of the book. Smart contracts will work as a decentralized eCommerce store, where authors will sell BOOK tokens and readers will be granted access to their book via Publica's e-reader app-wallet.</p>
                <p>Naturally, we want this eCommerce protocol to run on Publica currency, PBL. PBL is a platform currency, everything happening on the platform should be denominated in PBL and paid in PBL.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Will I have the flexibility to set up a Book ICO any way I want?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>It is totally up to the author how they choose to run their ICO. You can choose your own business model - set up a Book ICO campaign launch date, duration of the Book ICO campaign, price of the book during the ICO period and after (Price of a book must be greater than the ICO price, to provide incentive for people to support your project at the early stage and to be able to raise funding for your book).</p>
                <p>You can also select how many copies will be sold during the Book ICO campaign and how many book copies will be available in total (for example, you can set a maximum of 100 books to be sold during the Book ICO and sell up to 1000 books after the Book ICO).</p>
                <p>Finally, you can decide at what conditions your Book ICO campaign will be considered as successful or not. You can define so-called Soft Cap (the minimum amount of sold book copies during the Book ICO campaign to consider your Book ICO as successful) and Hard Cap (maximum amount of book copies available for sale during the Book ICO).</p>
                <p>Remember, once your Book ICO is launched, you will no longer be able to choose the Book ICO campaign's terms. Although authors will have the flexibility to set up a Book ICO according to their own business model, we recommend to choose the campaign’s terms carefully and consult with author-advisor if needed.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">I'm not a tech person, "Smart contracts" sounds complicated.. Is there a way to simplify smart contracts?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Although smart contracts may appear as something new and complicated, authors don’t need to have any technical knowledge in order to set up a smart contract (in fact, you don’t even set up a smart contract yourself).</p>
                <p>Before launching a Book ICO campaign, authors will be required to enter information about their Book ICO campaign. For example, authors will be asked to define a book’s price during the ICO and after the Book ICO is completed, Book ICO end date, amount of books sold during the Book ICO and the total amount of books that will be available for sale. When all required fields will be filled, authors can preview their campaign and make any changes they want.</p>
                <p>Once the Book ICO will be launched, the smart contract will be automatically deployed, based on the preferences set during Book ICO campaign setup. After launching Book ICO, authors will no longer be able to make changes (blockchain is decentralized and no one has rights to change the records).</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How can authors learn more about potential resellers?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Publica is providing tools for publishing your book on the blockchain, it is up to author to search and negotiate with potential resellers.</p>
                <p>The concept of selling tokens instead of book files or licenses, however, provides additional incentives and opportunities for readers to buy more books at a cheaper price during the Book ICO and later sell them on Publica’s BOOK token exchange (currently in development).</p>
                <p>We will provide more information on opportunities available by introducing a book secondary market.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Can’t I follow the blockchain to reach purchasers?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Blockchain by its nature is anonymous. You can only see a public wallet address in the blockchain, so it is not possible to reach or identify purchasers unless a purchaser is declaring somewhere on the Internet he/she is an owner of a wallet address.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Please elaborate on the “collectible” idea of a Book ICO</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Since every book that is published on Publica is represented with a unique BOOK token, one of the requirements in order to publish a book or run a Book ICO is to define a number of book copies that will be sold (authors can choose themselves the number of BOOK tokens = book copies they want to sell). This is creating a limited book supply (even is an author sells one million copies). Authors can leverage the fact that their book is distributed in a limited supply and create scarcity.</p>
                <p>If a book is demanded, and supply is limited, the value of a BOOK token can grow, thus there’s bigger chance that readers will buy the book.</p>
                <p>Currently, there’s a new trend of digital collectibles/crypto collectibles emerging, with new services appearing every day. People are excited about collecting rare tokens and Publica is the only platform that is offering books as tokens.</p>
                <p>By saying that, we want to inform authors on all the benefits that blockchain and Publica is providing. This might be an additional “selling point” for authors to find and attract new readers, however, the limited supply by itself is not guaranteeing a demand for the book.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Why do they call Publica - Ethereum for Ebooks?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Ethereum is known for a booming multi-billion ICO market. Publica is a small Ethereum tailored for publishing.</p>
                <p>We help to run ICOs to crowdfund creation of new books. Authors will build communities of fans, do marketing, come up with an exciting pricing and will use funds to create high-quality titles while keeping their creative freedom and IP rights. No need to sign thick contracts with large publishers that take away their freedom and leave mere 10% of the earnings!</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Why does Publica need a blockchain?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The publishing ecosystem needs a radical expansion of the popular phrase “trust, but verify.” Blockchain provides transparency.</p>
                <p>So, Publica has to put trust and verification on the blockchain by automating the ecommerce, engaging the blockchain that holds the ebook and derivative rights public keys, and their smart contracts, and the app/wallets involved in the ecommerce.</p>
                <p>Blockchain, smart-contracts and tokens sounds complicated..</p>
                <p>As an author or reader your don't need to think about the blockchain, smart-contracts or other technical details. It all will work under-the-hood in the Publica platform.</p>
